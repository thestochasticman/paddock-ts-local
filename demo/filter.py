from PaddockTS.filter import Filter

"""
Apart from datetime, geographical coordinates and collections, there are 
many other criteria based on which the user might want to select data.

Some common properties are

eo:cloud_cover           : Estimated cloud coverage percentage (0â€“100)
datetime                  : Day-Start/Month-Start/Year-Start/Day-end/Month-end/Year-end
platform                  : one of landsat-8, 'sentinel-2a, etc
gsd                       : ground sampling distance(meters)
dea:dataset_maturity      : final, interim, etc
dea:product_level         : level3, level2
dea:product               : ga_s2am_ard_3, etc
odc:processing_datetime   : When the dataset was processed
proj:shape
proj:transform

There are many more properties, we will try to add example usage for all soon.

### The filter object to create a filter where we want the
### eo:cloud_cover to be les than 10 can be created as follows

f1 = Filter.lt('eo:cloud_cover', 10)
f2 = Filter.from_string('eo:cloud_cover < 10')

### The filter object to choose sentinel-2a data can selected as follows
### Wrap the string value of the property in quotes when using Filter.from_string

f3 = Filter.eq('platform', 'sentinel-2a')
f4 = Filter.from_string('platform == "sentinel-2a"')
f5 = Filter.from_string('platform == "sentinel-2a"')


### To combine a filter object which uses landsat platform and contains
### records with eo:cloud_cover < 10

f6 = Filter.AND(f1, f3)
f7 = f1.AND(f3)
### Hope this is clear now
